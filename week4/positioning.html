            <h3>The World Of Cakes</h3>
            <h5>June 25, 2021</h5>
            <p>Where would we be in a world without cakes? I don't know, because cakes are so very delicious. The cakes like the image are one of the best. I know you would also agree right? Unless of course you can not have sweets. But then again there are ways to make cakes wthout so much sugar which also taste good. </p>

            <h5>August 13, 2020</h5>
            <p>Makeup is a girls bestfriend, especially if you really need it. Just joking, makeup is a girls bestfriend because it is fun to experiment. Most girls love makeup because it is a way to make them feel good about themselves. All the pretty colors and bright fun colors. There are tons of ways to use the different things provided for makeup.</p>
